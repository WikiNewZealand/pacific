# About {{site.title}}

{{site.title}} is a free tool to help Pacific people in Aotearoa access data and develop data skills to support their work.

You'll find a range of data about Pacific people and Pacific issues, and resources to help you understand and use the data.

## Who made this?

{{site.title}} is brought to you by [Figure.NZ](https://figure.nz). This project is supported by our friends at [Stats NZ](https://stats.govt.nz). We are very grateful for both their support and their shared passion for Pacific wellbeing through access to quality data.

A special mihi to Dr Ofa Ketu’u, who gifted us the name of '{{site.title}}'. Dr Ofa Ketu’u has worked at Statistics NZ for many years, holding managerial roles in different parts of the organisation. She is also a member of the Pacific Data Sovereignty Network. Between 2016-2019, she was Director of Statistics for Pacific Community (SPC) based in Noumea, New Caledonia. She has a very strong knowledge of economic and social statistics for Pacific people and her passion is ensuring Pacific people use statistics and data to inform decisions that affect their lives on a day-to-day basis. 

Ofa hails from the Kingdom of Tonga but also considers herself a New Zealand immigrant. She lives in the heart of South Auckland with her whanau. We want to acknowledge Dr Ofa’s contribution to this project but also her lifelong dedication to Pacific people's data and wellbeing.

We’d also like to acknowledge Afamasanga Jackie Curry, from Samoa. Jackie has been the project lead for the {{site.title}}, and provided invaluable cultural advice and community engagement. 

All of the beautiful illustrations you see on {{site.title}} are the work of the team at Bluwave and designer Martin Anae of Samoa and his Pacific digital agency. 


### Figure.NZ

Figure.NZ is a charity dedicated to getting the people of New Zealand using data to thrive. 

We do this because we want to live in a country where everyone can take part in creating a delightful New Zealand. We believe we can progress towards that by helping everyone in our country understand the things they care about so they can make great choices.

We’re committed to making New Zealand’s public, aggregate data available through our website — for free, for everyone, forever — because we believe data is not just for experts, and its true value lies in people using it in their day to day lives.

We’ve put data about New Zealand from over 175 different organisations into one easily searchable place, where more than 43,000 charts and datasets are available.

Now that we’ve established the technology, systems, and processes needed to make our country’s data easily available, we’re focused on getting it into the hands of New Zealanders, and providing the support they need to make good use of it.
