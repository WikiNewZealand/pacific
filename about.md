# About {{site.title}}

> NEEDS UPDATING

{{site.title}} is a free tool to help Pacific people in Aotearoa access data and develop data skills to support their work.

You'll find a range of data about Pacific people and Pacific issues, and resources to help you understand and use the data.

Can't find what you're looking for? Email us at <help@figure.nz> and let us know what you need.

## Who made this?

{{site.title}} is brought to you by [Figure.NZ](https://figure.nz). This project is supported by our friends at Stats NZ and Jackie Curry at Spacific Consultance. We are very grateful for both their support and their shared passion for Pacific wellbeing and economic success in Aotearoa.

### Figure.NZ

Figure.NZ is a charity dedicated to getting the people of New Zealand using data to thrive. 

We do this because we want to live in a country where everyone can take part in creating a delightful New Zealand. We believe we can progress towards that by helping everyone in our country understand the things they care about so they can make great choices.

We’re committed to making New Zealand’s public, aggregate data available through our website — for free, for everyone, forever — because we believe data is not just for experts, and its true value lies in people using it in their day to day lives.

We’ve put data about New Zealand from over 175 different organisations into one easily searchable place, where more than 43,000 charts and datasets are available.

Now that we’ve established the technology, systems, and processes needed to make our country’s data easily available, we’re focused on getting it into the hands of New Zealanders, and providing the support they need to make good use of it.
