# About {{site.title}}

{{site.title}} is a free tool to help Māori access data and develop data skills to support their mahi.

You'll find a range of data about Māori and Māori issues, and resources to help you understand and use the data.

## Who made this?

{{site.title}} is brought to you by [Figure.NZ](https://figure.nz). This project is supported by our friends in the Māori Economy team at [Callaghan Innovation](https://www.callaghaninnovation.govt.nz/access-experts/maori-economy). We are very grateful for both their support and their shared passion for Māori wellbeing and economic success.

A special mihi to Vincent Campbell who gifted us the name of Pātaka Raraunga. Pātaka is the name for a traditional Maori storehouse or cupboard, and Raraunga being the Maori word for Data.

### Figure.NZ

Figure.NZ is a charity dedicated to getting the people of New Zealand using data to thrive. 

We do this because we want to live in a country where everyone can take part in creating a delightful New Zealand. We believe we can progress towards that by helping everyone in our country understand the things they care about so they can make great choices.

We’re committed to making New Zealand’s public, aggregate data available through our website — for free, for everyone, forever — because we believe data is not just for experts, and its true value lies in people using it in their day to day lives.

We’ve put data about New Zealand from over 175 different organisations into one easily searchable place, where more than 43,000 charts and datasets are available.

Now that we’ve established the technology, systems, and processes needed to make our country’s data easily available, we’re focused on getting it into the hands of New Zealanders, and providing the support they need to make good use of it.
