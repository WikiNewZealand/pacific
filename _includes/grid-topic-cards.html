<!--This adds a section of cards to the page, usually used for the list of main topics for the site. 
  The default layout has a title for the section, followed by a grid of cards. 
  These cards are generated by iterating over the list in the topics folder.
  Each card has an image above a text section with a name. These are pulled from the YAML of the files in the topic page.
  Each card has links, also generated from the YAML of the topic file. In this example, they're set to an external URL, but could be changed to open a page on this site.
  The background colour can be either white or grey. The example is grey, but change to white-bg for white.
